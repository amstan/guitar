/*!
 * Receive a character from the UART Rx.
 *
 * This features a simple line-editor that allows to delete and re-edit the characters entered, until either CR or NL is entered. Printable characters entered will be echoed using uart_putchar().
 *
 * @par Editing characters:
 * - \\b (BS) or \177 (DEL) delete the previous character
 * - ^u kills the entire input buffer
 * - ^w deletes the previous word
 * - ^r sends a CR, and then reprints the buffer
 * - \t will be replaced by a single space
 *
 * All other control characters will be ignored.
 *
 * The internal line buffer is RX_BUFSIZE (80) characters long, which includes the terminating \\n (but no terminating \0).  If the buffer is full (i. e., at RX_BUFSIZE-1 characters in order to keep space for the trailing \\n), any further input attempts will send a \\a to uart_putchar() (BEL character), although line editing is still allowed.
 *
 * Input errors while talking to the UART will cause an immediate return of -1 (error indication).  Notably, this will be caused by a framing error (e. g. serial line "break" condition), by an input overrun, and by a parity error (if parity was enabled and automatic parity recognition is supported by hardware).
 *
 * Successive calls to uart_getchar() will be satisfied from the internal buffer until that buffer is emptied again.
