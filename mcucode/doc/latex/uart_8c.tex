Receive a character from the UART Rx. This features a simple line-\/editor that allows to delete and re-\/edit the characters entered, until either CR or NL is entered. Printable characters entered will be echoed using \hyperlink{uart_8c_a985ba70f2a53d95f1fd11f70f1d8f4f6}{uart\_\-putchar()}.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Editing characters:}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries }(BS) or  (DEL) delete the previous character
\item $^\wedge$u kills the entire input buffer
\item $^\wedge$w deletes the previous word
\item $^\wedge$r sends a CR, and then reprints the buffer
\item will be replaced by a single space
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
All other control characters will be ignored.

The internal line buffer is RX\_\-BUFSIZE (80) characters long, which includes the terminating $\backslash$n (but no terminating ). If the buffer is full (i. e., at RX\_\-BUFSIZE-\/1 characters in order to keep space for the trailing $\backslash$n), any further input attempts will send a $\backslash$a to \hyperlink{uart_8c_a985ba70f2a53d95f1fd11f70f1d8f4f6}{uart\_\-putchar()} (BEL character), although line editing is still allowed.

Input errors while talking to the UART will cause an immediate return of -\/1 (error indication). Notably, this will be caused by a framing error (e. g. serial line \char`\"{}break\char`\"{} condition), by an input overrun, and by a parity error (if parity was enabled and automatic parity recognition is supported by hardware).

Successive calls to \hyperlink{uart_8c_ae29d6eea5f2e7997551b4acb64082d8e}{uart\_\-getchar()} will be satisfied from the internal buffer until that buffer is emptied again.
